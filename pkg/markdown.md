# Markdown

[[markdown.md]] is a flexible markup format for text.

It can be used to generate HTML and other output.

Thanks to its flexibility and openness, Markdown is being supported by many IDE and ecosystems, such as [[vs_code.md]], [[github.md]].

It can integrate with other text-based formats, such as programming code and other markup languages. With extensions to render these other markup languages, markdown can include Math formula, charts, and code, etc.
